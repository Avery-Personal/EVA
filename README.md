*EVA* is a repository dedicated to recreating how EVAs (Evangelions) from NGE work and simulate internally. The goal of EVA is to create an EVA like system on how they work in the anime, and create a realistic automated machine that can be interacted with, with advanced features in place. By modeling these progressively from *EVA-00* to *EVA-04*, I strive to slowly but surely create a a realistic representation of how an EVA works. In terms of progressive, it's in the sense that *EVA-00* is a prototype EVA designed to get the ground work in for future types, with *EVA-04* being as realistic as the real deal.

For those unfamiliar with an *Evangelion*, an Evangelion, called EVAs for short, are a sort of robot from the anime NGE, with complex internals, such as a sync ratio, which reads the signs of a pilot and checks if they are syncing with the robot (Eva). Alongside more features such as the following: Berserking, Battery Modes, Actuator Outputs, System States, Dummy Plugs, etc.
