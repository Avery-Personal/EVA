*EVA* is a repository dedicated to recreating how EVAs (Evangelions) from NGE work and simulate internally. The goal of EVA is to create an EVA like system on how they work in the anime, and create a realistic automated machine that can be interacted with, with advanced features in place. By modeling these progressively from *EVA-00* to *EVA-04*, I strive to slowly but surely create a a realistic representation of how an EVA works. In terms of progressive, it's in the sense that *EVA-00* is a prototype EVA designed to get the ground work in for future types, with *EVA-04* being as realistic as the real deal.
